# Servants-Of-Justice
“Servants of Justice” is a tale of a group of teenagers that aspire to become the strongest. They live in the world of Chrysalis; the realm of Chrysalis is no ordinary world as the living beings are imbued with mystical powers called Masteries. Masteries were used as a way to support, foundate, or in other words, protect. As every good has its bad, the Heroes of this realm had their own bad and they were the Villains, the ones who committed mischievous acts, misusing their power and terrorising Chrysalis. To stop these rogues ‘The Heroes Initiative’ was created, a huge band of strong men, women and creatures who would use their Masteries to stop the Villains, and help the public and authorities. The group of teenagers enter a famous school that train people to become strong Heroes, and that school was called ‘CB Academy’.
